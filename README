A rough draft of a dependency diagram for the Ensembl Genomes release
pipeline. Arrows indicate (roughly) 'depends on'. Position (roughly)
indicates when the activity happens.

Currently there is no distinction between 'loading data' and 'pipeline
processing', but that could be added quite easily.

A red box indicates (roughly) an entry point into the process (at a
given time).
