A rough draft of a dependency diagram for the Ensembl Genomes release
pipeline. Arrows indicate (roughly) 'depends on'. Position (roughly)
indicates when the activity happens.

Currently there is no distinction between 'loading data' and 'pipeline
processing', but that could be added quite easily.

A red box indicates (roughly) an entry point into the process (at a
given time).

Note, the timeline is for schematic purposes only, and does not depict
accurate timing of events.

Phases are used to indicate 'implicit' dependencies. i.e. all
appropriate tasks from the previous phase should be finished before
the next phase begins... These deps should probably be made explicit.
